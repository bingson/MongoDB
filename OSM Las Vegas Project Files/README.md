# MongoDB Data Wrangling Project

>Choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about.

For this project I chose the Las Vegas because itâ€™s a medium sized city famous for its many casinos, providing readily available reference data I can use to check OSM accuracy and completeness.
